# Iris Flower Classification


The Iris flower classification problem is a quintessential example of supervised machine learning, aiming to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their physical attributes. Typically, the dataset consists of measurements including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for various Iris flowers. Initially, data exploration is conducted to comprehend the dataset's structure and the distribution of classes, which typically include Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Preprocessing steps may involve handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables. Following preprocessing, a machine learning model is selected, often including algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), or Neural Networks. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, where the model is trained on the training data. Post-training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its ability to correctly classify Iris flower species based on their attributes.


## Appendix
## Dataset Source: 
The Iris flower dataset used for classification is commonly available in machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and online repositories like the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features:

Sepal Length: The length of the sepals (the outer parts of the flower).
Sepal Width: The width of the sepals.
Petal Length: The length of the petals (the inner parts of the flower).
Petal Width: The width of the petals.
## Classes:

Iris Setosa: One of the three species of Iris flowers, characterized by its distinctive features.
Iris Versicolor: Another species of Iris flowers with its own unique characteristics.
Iris Virginica: The third species of Iris flowers, distinguishable by its specific attributes.
## Machine Learning Models:

Decision Trees: A versatile algorithm for classification tasks, capable of handling both numerical and categorical data.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for classification tasks, especially in high-dimensional spaces.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple yet powerful algorithm for classification based on the similarity of data points.
Neural Networks: Deep learning models that can capture complex patterns in data for accurate classification.
## Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
